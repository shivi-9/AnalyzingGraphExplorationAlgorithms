## Analyzing various Graph Exploration Algorithms

### Requirements
The code was written in Python 3.7. To run the code, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:
* pandas
* networkx
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:
```
pip install pandas networkx numpy seaborn matplotlib
```
### Usage
There are two ways to run this code. Either you can simple open the jupyter notebook and click on Run All cells (SUGGESTED WAY) or you can follow these steps to create a .py version of this notebook:
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook file is located.
2. Install nbconvert if you haven't already done so by running the command 
```
pip install nbconvert 
```
3. Run the following command to convert your .ipynb file to a Python script:
```
jupyter nbconvert --to script your_notebook.ipynb
```
This command will create a Python script with the same name as your Jupyter Notebook file, but with a .py extension.
4. Run the Python script by running the following command:
```
python Code.py
```
This will run all the cells in the Jupyter Notebook file.
